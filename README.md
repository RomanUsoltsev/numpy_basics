# NumPy Basics
Description:
NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vector Calculations. Activation functions.

The task is presented in Russian.


As part of the task (task.ipynb), functions (fun.py) are written:

def apply_f(a,f)

def basic_sigmoid(x)

def sigmoid(x)

def sigmoid_derivative(x)

def sigmoid_tan(x)

def sigmoid_lin(x)

def sigmoid_limit(x)

def sigmoid_relu(x)

def image_to_vector(image)

defsoftmax(x)

def normalize(x)

Tests for functions are also written (test_fun.py) testing starts from main.py

There is also an implementation in the .ipynb format (opens with Jupyter or Google Colaboratory).
